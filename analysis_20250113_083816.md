This guide explains how to use the "Super Interview Repository" to generate interview forms and process candidate responses. This tool helps you create a Google Form from a Google Doc, pre-fill example answers, and generate assessment reports.

## 1. Main Functions and Uses

This repository provides a set of Google Apps Script functions that work together to:

*   **Create Interview Forms:** Automatically generate Google Forms from a list of questions in a Google Doc.
*   **Generate Sample Answers:** Use Gemini AI to create realistic, detailed answers for each question.
*   **Create Response Sheets:** Automatically create a Google Sheet to collect responses, and format it with the question titles.

In short, this tool helps you streamline your interview process by automating the creation of the form, response sheet, and candidate assessments.

## 2. Code Structure

The repository is organized into several Google Apps Script files, each responsible for a specific task:

*   **`suggestAnswers.gs`:**  This file uses the Gemini API to generate realistic sample answers for the interview questions.
*   **`webapp.gs`:** This file handles the web app's doGet function and provides the main interface for the form generation process. It also handles errors and passes data to the front end.
*  **`README.md`**: This file contains basic project description.
*   **`createForm.gs`:**  This file creates the Google Form using questions from a Google Doc.
*   **`prefilledLink.gs`:** This file generates the pre-filled form link using the sample answers.
*   **`makePublic.gs`:**  This file sets the generated form to be public, meaning anyone can fill it out without logging in.
*   **`index.html`:** This file contains the HTML and JavaScript code for the web interface (frontend).
*   **`test.gs`:** This file contains various test and debugging functions used to log data, and simulate form submissions. It also generates the assessment report and emails.
*   **`findEntryIds.gs`:** This file extracts the entry IDs from the form needed for the pre-filled URL.
*   **`LICENSE`:** This file provides the project's license information.
*   **`findQuestions.gs`:** This file reads interview questions from a Google Doc, validates that it contains basic info questions, and uses Gemini AI to validate the questions according to provided aspects.
*   **`finddoc.gs`:** This file helps the frontend interface retrieve a list of Google Docs in the project folder.
*   **`createSheel.gs`:** This file creates the response Google Sheet in the target folder. It creates the Form Questions sheet, and the Aspects sheet.
*   **`config.gs`:** This file manages the configuration settings, such as API keys, folder IDs, and document IDs.
*   **`Code.gs`:** This is the main file. It controls the flow of operations.
